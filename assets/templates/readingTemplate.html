                <p>Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions.</p>
                <p>Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole.</p>
                <p>After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a
                    <q>NO CHANGE</q> option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.</p>

                            <p>Questions 1-10 are based on the following passage.</p>
                            <p>This passage is from Charlotte Bront&#235;, <em>The Professor,</em> originally published in 1857.</p>
                            <p>No man likes to acknowledge that he has made a mistake in the choice of his profession, and every man, worthy of the name, will row long against wind and tide before he allows himself to cry out,
                                <q>I am baffled!</q> and submits to be floated passively back to land. From the first week of my residence in X&#8212;felt my occupation irksome. The thing itself&#8212;the work of copying and translating business-letters&#8212;was a dry and tedious task enough, but had that been all, I should long have borne with the nuisance&#59; I am not of an impatient nature, and influenced by the double desire of getting my living and justifying to myself and others the resolution I had taken to become a tradesman, I should have endured in silence the rust and cramp of my best faculties&#59; I should not have whispered, even inwardly, that I longed for liberty&#59; I should have pent in every sigh by which my heart might have ventured to intimate its distress under the closeness, smoke, monotony, and joyless tumult of Bigben Close, and its panting desire for freer and fresher scenes&#59; I should have set up the image of Duty, the fetish of Perseverance, in my small bedroom at Mrs. King&#59;s lodgings, and they two should have been my household gods, from which my darling, my cherished-in-secret, Imagination, the tender and the mighty, should never, either by softness or strength, have severed me. But this was not all&#59; <span id="q7a">the antipathy which had sprung up between myself and my employer striking deeper root and spreading denser shade daily, excluded me from every glimpse of the sunshine of life&#59;</span> and I began to feel like a plant growing in humid darkness out of the slimy walls of a well.</p>
                            <p>Antipathy is the only word which can express the feeling Edward Crimsworth had for me&#8212;a feeling, in a great measure, involuntary, and which was liable to be excited by every, the most trifling movement, look, or word of mine. My southern accent annoyed him&#59; the degree of education evinced in my language irritated him&#59; my punctuality, industry, and accuracy, fixed his dislike, and gave it the high flavour and poignant relish of envy&#59; he feared that I too should one day make a successful tradesman. Had I been in anything inferior to him, he would not have hated me so thoroughly, but I knew all that he knew, and, what was worse, he suspected that I kept the padlock of silence on mental wealth in which he was no sharer. If he could have once placed me in a ridiculous or mortifying position, he would have forgiven me much, but I was guarded by three faculties&#8212;Caution, Tact, Observation&#59; and prowling and prying as was Edward&#39;s malignity, it could never baffle the lynx-eyes of these, my natural sentinels. Day by day did his malice watch my tact, hoping it would sleep, and prepared to steal snake-like on its slumber&#59; but tact, if it be genuine, never sleeps.</p>
                            <p>I had received my first quarter&#39;s wages, and was returning to my lodgings, possessed heart and soul with the pleasant feeling that the master who had paid me grudged every penny of that hard-earned pittance&#8212;(I had long ceased to regard Mr. Crimsworth as my brother&#8212;he was a hard, grinding master&#59; he wished to be an inexorable tyrant: that was all). Thoughts, not varied but strong, occupied my mind&#59; two voices spoke within me&#59; again and again they uttered the same monotonous phrases. One said:
                                <q>William, your life is intolerable.</q> The other:
                                <q>What can you do to alter it?</q> I walked fast, for it was a cold, frosty night in January&#59; as I approached my lodgings, I turned from a general view of my affairs to the particular speculation as to whether my fire would be out&#59; looking towards the window of my sitting-room, I saw no cheering red gleam.</p>
